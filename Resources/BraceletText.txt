Copy from ebayWelcome to Steffie's Sparkles! This handmade beaded bracelet features 8mm genuine hematite, natural lava rock, and banded amethyst. (NOTE: the lava rock beads look more gray than black because they are completely natural: no dyes, no oils, no wax, but they will darken with use. Many other sellers make these with waxed beads, which will not absorb oil very well.) Wear it just because it looks cool or add a few drops of essential oil to any one or two of the lava beads to take your favorite scent with you wherever you go! Please note that these natural gemstones vary slightly in size/appearance/surface texture. ***Contains NO metal, making this great for those who have metal allergies.*** SIZING (recently updated) Made with very thick elastic cord in any size you need for a perfect fit! To determine your size, *MEASURE YOUR WRIST* and ADD: .25" for a TIGHT against your skin fitting bracelet (if your hands are large/wide I do not recommend this option as it will excessively stretch your bracelet over time.) .5" for a comfortably SNUG fitting bracelet (recommended choice.).75" for a very LOOSE fitting bracelet (will likely move freely up and down your forearm.) If you need a size other than the options listed in the drop down menu, please send me a message. ***Need more bracelets than the quantity I have listed as available? Send me a message and I'll let you know if I have enough supplies to do a special order just for you!***
